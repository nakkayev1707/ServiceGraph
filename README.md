# ServiceGraph

ServiceGraph is a C# library designed to visualize and manage the dependencies between services in a microservices architecture. This tool helps developers and system administrators understand and maintain the complex web of interdependencies in modern software systems.

## Features

- **Dependency Visualization**: Displays a graphical representation of service dependencies.
- **Circular Dependency Detection**: Identify and highlight circular dependencies to prevent potential issues in your microservices architecture.
- **Interactive Graph**: Nodes and edges are clickable, providing detailed information about each service and its dependencies.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently handles large numbers of services and dependencies.
- **Customizable Views**: Filter and organize the graph to focus on specific aspects of the system.

## Installation
